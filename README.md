### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Defines the basic structure of the web application. It will be used to design the layout of the home-login screen, game screen inclduing buttons, result screen, how-to-play screen, about screen, and scoreboards.
- **CSS** - Specifies the style of the game screen. It enhances user experience by applying button colors, layouts, animations, and responsive design.
- **React** - React will manage each part of the game with a component-based structure. It dynamically handles user selections, game states, and scoreboard updates.
- **JavaScript** - Implements the functionality of the game. It calculates results based on user input and updates the game state accordingly.
- **Node.js** - Manages the backend server and handles data processing for the game. It stores user scores and records or calculates game results.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - Login with Auth0 authentification API
    - Creating game sessions
    - Submitting player choices
    - Retrieving game scores
    - Generating invite links
- **DB/Login** - Stores and manages user-ID, game records, and user scores. This ensures the persistence of win points and ranking data.
- **WebSocket** - Ensures real-time updates for player actions and results.
