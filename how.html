            <p>In this game, you will take turns playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against game agents.</p>
            <p>I trust you know the rules, however, we will add some additional rules.</p>

            <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You must select one of rock, papaer and scissors for your left hand and another for your right hand within the given time limit.</li>
                <li>Your opponent will also select two options simultaneously, one for their left hand and one for their right hand.</li>
                <li>Once both players make their selections, the choices will be revealed to each other at the same time.</li>
                <li>Each player must then decide which one of their two hands (left or right) they want to use for the final showdown. Make your final decision within the time limit.</li>
                <li>The winner is determined based on the final choices of both players.</li>
                <li>If you win, you will proceed to play against the next agent in the sequence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips for Winning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Think about your opponentâ€™s potential choices and counter them strategically.</li>
                <li>As the game progresses, the agents will become smarter, and the time limit will become shorter. Stay focused!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hall of Fame</h2>
            <p>The number of times you complete all rounds will be recorded in the Hall of Fame.</p>
